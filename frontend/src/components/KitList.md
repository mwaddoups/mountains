## Kit List

See below for a reference kit list for our outdoor walks. This is intended for use as a guide and won't cover all
situations and personal preferences, but if you're ever unsure what to bring hopefully this will serve as a reference!

### Preparation for a hill day

We strongly recommend registering for the 999 text service - this enables you to text for help from 999 services even when you might not have enough signal to make a phone call. To contact Mountain Resuce, you call (or text!) 999 and ask for the Police and then Mountain Rescue. Details on how to register are [here](https://www.scottishmountainrescue.org/how-to-call-for-help-emergency-in-the-hills/)



### Essential wear

- Walking Boots (preferably waterproof)
- Warm Socks (with a spare pair at the car for wet days)
- Warm bottom layer - thermals are best or synthetic sports shirts work well
- Warm mid-layer - a fleece or similar
- Hiking Trousers or Leggings (anything comfortable that doesn't hold water i.e. no jeans)

### Essential in your bag

- Waterproof Jacket
- Waterproof Trousers
- Spare warm layers - enough for you. An insulated jacket is worth having in cold conditions.

### Club Kit

The club has a growing library of kit that members are welcome to borrow. This includes maps, guidebooks, helmets, ice axes and crampons. 

As the club lends items from a pool of kit, anyone who borrows the kit should check the condition of the items before using it, be happy they know how to use it and finally report any damage to the club, where we will keep a record of it. 

Basically, make sure you are happy with the condition of any kit you borrow before using it. If you have any questions, please let Matt Borthwick (Committee Member, Kit) know. [For reference, here is the Mountaineering Scotland kit policy](https://www.mountaineering.scot/assets/contentfiles/pdf/Safety-and-liability-guidance-for-clubs-revision-May-2017.pdf), and [here is the BMC guidance on checking kit](https://www.thebmc.co.uk/bmc-technical-advice-booklets)

### First aid kit
The contents of a kit is personal and the best way to understand what to take is to do an outdoor first aid course.
That being said, this is what we have in the club first aid kits. We strongly recommend anyone going out on the hill takes their own kit.

- Trauma (major bleed) dressing (10cmx18cm)
- Scissors
- Tick remover
- Selection of plasters (inc. blister plasters)

If you're keen to pick up more gear cheaply, Decathlon is one of the best options for cheap, good quality gear in Glasgow. For higher quality gear, Cotswold Outdoor and Tiso both have a good selection and have a discount for Mountaineering Scotland members (which you will get with club membership).
