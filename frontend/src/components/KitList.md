## Kit List

See below for a reference kit list for our outdoor walks. This is intended for use as a guide and won't cover all
situations and personal preferences, but if you're ever unsure what to bring hopefully this will serve as a reference!

If you're keen to pick up more gear cheaply, Decathlon is one of the best options for cheap, good quality gear in Glasgow. For higher quality gear, Cotswold Outdoor and Tiso both have a good selection and have a discount for Mountaineering Scotland members (which you will get with club membership).

### Essential wear

- Walking Boots (preferably waterproof)
- Warm Socks (with a spare pair at the car for wet days)
- Warm bottom layer - thermals are best or synthetic sports shirts work well
- Warm mid-layer - a fleece or similar
- Hiking Trousers or Leggings (anything comfortable that doesn't hold water i.e. no jeans)

### Essential in your bag
