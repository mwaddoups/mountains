Our weekly bouldering event! Drop in anytime between 6pm and 8pm. Beginners welcome!

These will alternate between the Prop Store and the Newsroom, and should be a great opportunity to meet other members and get some climbing done!

Keep an eye on the discord for trying to track people down in the gym. 

TCA charge £11 (+£3 for shoe hire if needed), or £44 per month (or 5 punches) - this covers both centres.
