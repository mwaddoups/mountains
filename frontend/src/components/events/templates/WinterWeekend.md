[Describe in one or two sentences what the weekend trip is]

**To confirm your place on the trip you will need to join this event and transfer the trip cost to the club bank account. The details for this are in the text below.**

**Please note - as this is a winter trip we expect attendees to bring winter gear and be competent in its use if they are expecting to be walking in snow. Our usual bar for this is completion of a two day winter skills course. If you are unsure, please contact the trip organiser.**

[Include any other headline info (e.g. does the hut permit dogs? are there waiting list options?)]

### The Plan

Describe the trip:
  - How are we getting there?
  - What days are we there for?
  - Any carsharing specifics?
  - How many days of walking?
  - Any specific routes in mind?
  - What are the food plans?
  - Link to the hut website

### Getting There

- Where is the hut?
- Include an address, OS reference, google maps link, and distance from Glasgow.
- Access to the hut - will the walk organiser share the code?
- Mention need for snow chains or similar

### Facilities

- How many people does it sleep?
- What kind of beds does it have?
- Electricity / Gas / running water / ovens / microwaves / fridges / crockery
- Does it have toilet paper?
- Does it have showers?
- Do we know if it has phone signal?

### What to bring

I would suggest bringing two bags - one day pack for your hiking gear, and one overnight bag for the rest of your stuff.

Overnight gear:
- [Do they need a sleeping bag? Does it need to be warm?]
- Washbag and toiletries (inc. toilet paper, though the hut should have some)

Regarding food, we usually arrange group meals for the nights we're at the hut but this will be confirmed at a later date and you may want to bring your own dinners anyway. Other than that you will need:
- Snacks and lunches for each day on the hill.
- Breakfast for each day

As this is a winter trip, we suggest bringing
- Ice Axe
- Crampons
- Helmet (strongly recommended)
- Headtorch

Other things you might want
- Alcohol if you fancy it for the evenings!
- Cards or games could be fun
- Phone charger (though there may not be signal)
- Casual clothes for the evenings

Otherwise, bring all the gear you would normally bring for a day walk. Our kit list at the side covers this. You may want to consider spares if you have them in case your gear gets soaked on the first day.

### Cost

It costs [Â£xxxx] to cover [how many nights?] nights in the hut. Also factor in some petrol money for drivers, and costs towards the shared food if interested.
