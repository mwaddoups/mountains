Please read our participation statement below in full.

**Clyde Mountaineering Club recognises that climbing and mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or death.**

**Participants in these activities should be aware of and accept these risks and be responsible for their own actions and involvement.**

All walk participants are reminded that walk coordinators are not leading walks, and all those participating should make themselves fully aware of the route, what it entails and be prepared with appropriate kit and equipment. 

For a list of recommended kit and safety advice, please see the [Kit List page on the sidebar](https://clydemc.org/platform/kitlist). Please ask the walk coordinator or in Discord regarding any questions about equipment.

Do you understand the participation statement and our equipment expectations?
